# GoQuiz

A quiz `API` written in `Go` with 
[Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber).

It is completely open-source, so feel free to download
and build a quiz using this project. Just give credit
to me, please â€“ being nice is greatly appreciated. ;)

## How it operates?

To begin, let me illustrate the folder structure I
used in developing this application.

```
ğŸ“¦ GoQuiz project
    ğŸ“‚ app
        ğŸ“‚ handlers
        ğŸ“‚ repository
        ğŸ“‚ requests
    ğŸ“‚ database
        ğŸ“‚ models
    ğŸ“‚ http
    ğŸ“‚ helpers
    ğŸ“‚ routes
    ğŸ“œ .env
    ğŸ“œ main.go
```

I established a "handlers" folder where I defined
various structs and their associated methods. Subsequently,
I registered these handlers in the `routes/api.go` file. Therefore,
when a request is sent to the server, Fiber autonomously
handles the process, invokes the designated handler method,
and returns the corresponding response. That's all.

Middleware, authentication, and session management are defined
in the `http` folder.

For the database, I am utilizing the `gorm` package 
with a MySQL database.
